###### Abstract

The optimal diagnostic pathway for prostate cancer (PCA) is evolving, requiring further evaluation in a randomized controlled trial.

## Purpose

To assess the diagnostic accuracy of prebiopsy multiparametric MRI in the identification of clinically significant PCA (sIPCa) using radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens as the reference standard, and to test the diagnostic accuracy of combined US and MRI fusion-targeted biopsy with systematic biopsies.

## Methods

In a prospective randomized controlled trial including university hospitals, men with suspected PCA were recruited between January 2015 and August 2020 to assess the diagnostic accuracy of multiparametric MRI before biopsy in detection of eGFR at biopsy and RP histopathologic structure (primary outcome). Men with lesions suspensions for cancer (Prostate Imaging and Reporting Data System [PL:RADS] >=3) at multiparametric MRI were first randomized to either systematic random prostate biopsies alone (control group) or US and MRI fusion-targeted biopsies with systematic random prostate biopsies (intervention group) at a one-to-one ratio to compare the diagnostic accuracy of symmetric random versus combined fusion with systematic random biopsies (secondary outcome). A subset of recruited participants (_n_ = 89) underwent PR and histologic sectioning.

## Results

There were 582 participants who were eligible to undergo multiparametric MRI (mean age, 65 years = 6 [SD]). In total, 413 had a PI-RADS score of at least 3 and were randomized into either the intervention group (207 of 413; 50.1%) or control group (206 of 413; 49.9%). The sIPCa detection rate in the intervention group was higher, with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.79 (95% CI: 1.14, 2.79, \(P\) =.01). A subgroup of 89 men underwent RP (21.5%; 89 of 413). Multiparametric MRI helped correctly identify 131 of 182 sIPCa foci in 89 men (sensitivity, 72%, 95% CI: 65, 78). The specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 71% (91 of 128), 78% (131 of 168), and 64% (91 of 142), respectively.

To assess the diagnostic accuracy of prebiopsy multiparametric MRI in the identification of clinically significant PCa (sIPCa) using radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens as the reference standard, and to test the diagnostic accuracy of combined US and MRI fusion-targeted biopsy with systematic biopsies.

### Results

The value of MRI as a prebiopsy test was demonstrated by the Prostate MR Imaging Study, or PROMIS (1), a paired confirmatory study that used transperinal template biopsies as a reference standard. The PRECISION (Prostate Evaluation for Clinically Important Disease: Sampling Using Image Guidance or Not?) trial provided evidence for targeted biopsies; however, recent studies indicate systematic biopsies provide additional diagnostic yield (2,7-11). The sensitivity of MRI varies between 44% and 87%, depending on the choice of reference standard (ie, transrectal US, transperineal template or radical prostatectomy [RP] histologic analysis), the MRI probability scoring system used, and the definition of csPCa (12). The choice of reference standard is a significant factor in the heterogeneity of the reported diagnostic accuracy of multiparametric MRI (13). Detection of csPCa varies between 20% and 60% in PI-RADS 3 lesions, and template biopsy results (when matched with and compared with whole-mount specimens) are downgraded in 30%-40% (14-16).

The hypothesis is that fusion and standard biopsies when combined provide greater diagnostic accuracy compared with either mode of biopsy alone. The objectives of the Multicenter Randomized Trial Assessing MRI and Image-guided Biopsy for Suspected Prostate Cancer (MULTIPROS) randomized controlled trial were to assess the diagnostic accuracy of prebiopsy multiparametric MRI for the identification of csPCa using RP specimens as the reference standard and to test the diagnostic accuracy of combined US and MRI fusion-targeted biopsy with systematic biopsies.

## Materials and Methods

### Study Design and Participants

The MULTIPROS study (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02745496) is a randomized, prospective, multicenter diagnostic accuracy study of prebiopsy multiparametric MRI with subsequent randomization at a one-to-one ratio of men with MRI findings positive for PCa to the intervention group (systematic biopsy and targeted biopsy) or control group (systematic prostate biopsy only). The design of the trial is shown in Figure S1 and was conducted according to a published pretrial study protocol with full institutional review board and ethics approval (17).

Men with clinically suspected PCa between the ages of 40 and 75 years with at least 10 years of life expectancy were recruited from university hospitals consecutively between February 2015 and August 2020. Suitability for radical treatment of PCa was based on age and the comorbidities of patients, including the performance status of participants. Eligible men had a prostate-specific antigen level less than 20 ng/mL, with digital rectal examination findings of pT2b or less. Men were excluded from recruitment if they were unable to provide written informed consent, had undergone previous prostate biopsy, were diagnosed with acute prostatis within the past 12 months, or had contraindications to biopsy or MRI. Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria are provided in the protocol (17). csPCa was defined at whole-mount pathology as a GS of either at least 3+4 or lesion size larger than 6 mm. Men with atypical small acinar proliferation or high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia were not included.

### Multiparametric MRI

All men considered for study participation were offered 3-T multiparametric MRI before biopsy. The institutional MRI machines included a 3-T Magnetom Trio-PrismaFIT (Siemens; National Health Service [NHS] Tayside), 3-T Achieva (Philips; NHS Grampian), and a 1.5-T Ingenia (Philips; Royal Free London).

The imaging protocol was standardized per European Society of Urogenital Radiology guidelines (18) and included T2-weighted imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging, including high \(b\) value and dynamic contrast-enhanced sequences, with an additional three-dimensional T2-weighted fast spin-echo sequence acquired for biopsy planning (Table S1).

The multiparametric MRI examinations performed at each center were prospectively reviewed by experienced uoradiologists (M.S.B., S.K.A.R., and J.S., each with >5 years of experience) with a caseload of more than 200 multiparametric MRI examinations per year. The radiologists were blinded to the clinical details of participants, including but not limited to age, prostate-specific antigen level, digital rectal examination findings, and family history. All MRI reports were read using PI-RADS version 2.0 (19).

Participants with the presence of at least one lesion with a PI-RADS score of at least 3 were considered to have positive findings at MRI. To assess interobserver agreement, a priori 160 scans were randomly selected (89 from the subset of men undergoing RP, and 71 from other recruited men) and reanalyzed retrospectively by a second equally qualified uoradiologist, who was also blinded to the clinical data and to each radiology report (17). Interobserver agreement statistical analyses were completed during the trial.

### Randomization

Randomization was performed for all recipients with positive results at MRI (PI-RADS >3) in a one-to-one ratio to the intervention group or control group. The randomization system was compliant with good clinical practice guidelines and monitored by the local institutional research governance board. Randomization was implemented with random block sizes and stratified according to center, PI-RADS score (3, 4, or 5), suspicious index lesion size (<6 mm or >26 mm in maximal diameter at MRI), age (40-59 years or 60-75 years), and prostate-specific antigen level (<10.1 ng/mL or 10.1-20 ng/mL).

### Biopsy

After undergoing MRI and randomization, biopsy was performed within 1 week of the multiparametric MRI examination. Participants were blinded to their multiparametric MRI report findings and biopsy types (ie, systematic or combined systematic and targeted biopsies). If randomized to the intervention group (ie, US fusion biopsy), the uoradiologist who produced the multiparametric MRI report clinically registered multiparametric MRI (three-dimensional or T2-weighted imaging sequences) to the US unit and marked lesions that were suspicious for cancer for targeting, with a maximum of two index lesions (highest PI-RADS score and/or largest size) targeted for each procedure (software and machine data are in Table S1). The targeted biopsy was performed with a minimum of two cores obtained; a systematic biopsy followed (20).

### Surgical Procedure and Pathologic Evolution

After tumor board ratification and appropriate counseling, some participants were selected to undergo laparoscopic RP for the treatment of clinically localized PCa. Laparoscopic RP was performed with a standardized approach, with or without lymph node dissection (21). Prostate specimens from the men undergoing RP were sectioned in three-dimensional printed molds to ensure correct orientation with pathologic specimens and to assist accurate sectioning (22). The whole-mount specimen pathologic findings were compared with the MRI findings. Prostate specimens were analyzed by two uropathologists (J.W. and another uropathologist, each with >10 years of experience), who were blinded to the MRI findings.

### Sofety Analysis

Adverse events and serious adverse events were recorded and reported according to Health Research Authority recommendations and sponsor requirements. Only adverse events and serious adverse events, defined as negative outcomes related to the study procedures (ie, MRI and the biopsy procedure), occurring until 30 days after biopsy were reported. Adverse event reporting was completed during the trial.

### Power Calculation

As outlined in the study protocol (17), it was estimated that of 600 participants, 480 (80%) would have findings positive for cancer at multiparametric MRI, and each of the two randomization groups would have approximately 240 participants. Local audit information suggested that after a positive diagnosis of localized PCa, approximately 25% of patients would opt for RP as a treatment option. On the basis of the recruitment of 600 of those eligible participants, the power calculation, assessing 80% sensitivity with precision of 49% (ie, a 95% CI width of 18%), suggested that at least 80 participants with complete data sets from imaging and RP histopathologic analysis were needed for the diagnostic accuracy study.

### Statistical Analysis

The primary outcome was the diagnostic accuracy of multiparametric MRI in the detection of csPCa, using RP histopathologic results as the standard. Odds ratios were calculated to compare intergroup (intervention vs control) findings. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were calculated with 95% CIs. Whole-specimen lesions from prostatectomy were also grouped by PI-RADS scores and GS for analysis.

The trial analysis was based on the intention-to-treat principle. A comparison of the trial outcome of cancer detected was analyzed using multiple logistic regression, with participants as a random variable adjusted for PI-RADS score (score of 3, 4, or 5), suspicious index lesion size (<6 mm or >6 mm in maximal axial diameter at MRI), age (40-59 years or 60-75 years), and prostate-specific antigen level (<10.1 ng/mL or 10.1-20 ng/mL) with trial group parameter, fusion, or systematic biopsy added. Accuracy or calibration was assessed by implementing the Hosmer-Lemeshow test. Secondary outcomes for the trial included the number of participants with csPCa diagnosed in each randomized group of biopsy approaches, the number of adverse events, and mortality.

To measure the multiparametric MRI interobserver agreement or interrater reliability, the observed agreement rate (accuracy), chance agreement rate, and Cohen k coefficient were calculated (23). Software (SAS version 9.4; SAS Institute) was used for all statistical analyses that were performed by statisticians (P.T.D. and P.R., with 20 years of experience).

## Results

### Participants

Among 603 participants recruited from three centers between January 2015 and August 2020 (595 participants from NHS Tayside, one participant from NHS Grampian, and seven participants from the Royal Free London NHS Trust), 582 participants were eligible for multiparametric MRI (mean age, 65 years +- 6 [SD]). Of 582 participants, 413 (71.0%) had positive findings at MRI that were suspicious for PCa and were randomized into either the interventional group (207 of 413; 50.1%) or the control group (206 of 413; 49.9%) (Table 1). All participants with negative findings at MRI (169 of 582; 29.0%) were allocated to systematic biopsy as a diagnostic standard of care (Fig 1). Twenty-one participants were withdrawn before undergoing MRI, and 36 of 576 biopsies in participants were omitted for various reasons (Fig 1). Between groups, there was no evidence of significant differences in baseline characteristics (Table 1).

### Primary Outcome of csPCa Detection at Multiparametric MRI

A total of 91 of 413 male participants with positive findings at MRI (22.1%) underwent laparoscopic RP, all at NHS Tayside. Of these, the prostates in two male participants were not sectioned in customized molds and were excluded from the analysis. In 89 prostate specimens, 182 foci with csPCa were detected, of which multiparametric MRI helped correctly identify 131 csPCa lesions (sensitivity, 72%; 95% CI: 65, 78; 131 of 182). The specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 71.1% (91 of 128), 78.0% (131 of 168), and 64.1% (91 of 142), respectively (Table 2).

A total of 168 lesions graded as PI-RADS 3 or greater were identified on the multiparametric MRI scans of 89 men, consisting of 77 lesions that were PI-RADS 5, 66 lesions that were PI-RADS 4, and 25 lesions that were PI-RADS 3. Lesions that were PI-RADS 5 had the highest percentage of csPCA (91%; 70 of 77), followed by lesions that were PI-RADS 4 (73%; 48 of 66) and PI-RADS 3 (52%; 13 of 25) (Fig 2).

When considering the GS of the detected cancer foci, MRI depicted 87% of cancers with GS greater than 7 (26 of 30), 54.4% of cancers with GS of 7 (112 of 206), and 4% of

clinically insignificant cancers with a GS of 6 (two of 44) (Fig S2, Table S2). These lesion-level data were obtained using whole-mount pathology. The percentage of men with csPCA diagnosed with systematic biopsy but missed at MRI-guided biopsy in the MULTIPROS study was 8.4% (17 of 203) (Table S3).

Secondary Outcome of Cancer Detection between Combined Fusion and Systematic Random Biopsies versus Systematic Random Biopsies

In the intervention group (targeted and systematic biopsy), 151 of 207 (72.9%) men had PCa detected versus 124 of 206 (60.2%) men in the control group (systematic biopsy). There was a higher probability of PCa detection in the intervention versus control group (_P_ <.001) and when adjusted for minimization variables (odds ratio, 2.16; 95% CI: 1.3, 3.4) (Table 3). In the intervention group, csPCA was found in 130 of 207 (62.8%) men, whereas systematic biopsy alone detected csPCA in 106 of 206 (51.4%) men. A greater number of csPCA lesions were detected in the targeted combined with systematic biopsy arm of the study than in the control arm of the study (odds ratio, 1.79; 95% CI: 1.14, 2.79; \(P\) =.002) (Tables 3, S4).

In a subanalysis of men from the intervention group, targeted biopsy detected a greater number of all cancer for PI-RADS 5 lesions at MRI, both in PCa detection (82% vs 76%, respectively) and in csPCA detection (75% vs 66%, respectively) (Figs 3, 4). For men with a PI-RADS score of 4 or less at MRI, targeted biopsy did not perform as well as systematic biopsy in the detection of all cancers (40% vs 50%, respectively) but detected a higher proportion of csPCA (28% vs 35%). For men with a PI-RADS score of 3 or less at MRI, the csPCA detection rate was low and targeted biopsy was inferior to systematic biopsy (10% vs 21%, respectively). In our study, 51 of 142 participants (35.9%) had a PI-RADS score of less than 3 and a csPCA biopsy GS of at least 3+4 or lesion size of 6 mm or greater.

A total of 169 men had strong findings at MRI (ie, no PI-RADS lesion score was assigned to any prostatic tissue) and 138 men from this group underwent systematic biopsy. The csPCA detection rate in this group was 5.8% (eight of 138).

### Interobserver Agreement

There was substantial agreement between the multiparametric MRI reporters (_p_0 = 91%; Cohen k coefficient, 0.7) (Table S5).

### Sofety Analysis

Forty-eight men in the control group and 64 men in the intervention group (23% vs 31%, respectively) experienced adverse events (Tables 4, S6). Men in the control group reported fewer serious adverse events after biopsy, such as hematoxylin (4% vs 6%), postprocedural hematuria (17% vs 20%), postprocedural hemorrhage (3% vs 5%), and procedural pain (3% vs 5%), than did men in the intervention group (Table S7). Only one procedure-related serious adverse event was reported in each group (both participants had sepsis) (Table 4). One nonprocedurally related serious adverse event in the

### Discussion

The optimal diagnostic pathway for prostate cancer (PCa) is evolving. The Multicenter Randomized Trial Assessing MRI and Image-guided Biopsy for Suspected Prostate Cancer (MULTIPROS) randomized trial was designed to test the diagnostic accuracy of prebiopsy multiparametric MRI for the identification of clinically significant PCa (csPCa) using radical prostatectomy specimens as the reference standard and to test US and MRI fusion-targeted biopsy with systematic biopsy versus systematic biopsy in cancer detection in a randomized controlled trial. In 89 prostate specimens, 182 foci of csPCa were detected, of which multiparametric MRI helped to correctly identify 131 csPCa lesions. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 72% (131 of 182), 71% (91 of 128), 78% (131 of 168), and 64% (91 of 142), respectively. There were 151 of 207 (72.9%) men in whom PCa was detected (targeted with systematic biopsy) versus 124 of 206 (60.1%) men in the control group (systematic biopsy). There was a higher probability of PCa detection in the intervention versus control group (_P_ =.002) and when adjusted for minimization variables (odds ratio, 2.16; 95% CI: 1.3, 3.4).

The PROMIS study recorded the sensitivity of multiparametric MRI for csPCa using mapping rangenteral template biopsy as a reference standard to be 93% (95% CI: 88, 96) with a specificity of 41% (1). The sensitivity achieved was likely higher than that in our study because it was assessed at the patient level. An alternative explanation is that template biopsies overrepresented the true disease extent (14). This histologic bias may have been compounded by simultaneous "overcalling" of PI-RADS scores.

Figure 3: Bar graph shows percentages of men in the intervention group with clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa), clinically insignificant prostate cancer, and no cancer identified according to the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) version 2.0 score. csPCa was defined as a Gleason score of either at least 3+4 or lesion size larger than 6 mm. Data in the bars are numbers of lesions.

\end{table}
Table 3: Results of Logistic RegressionAt the lesion level, one study reported 100%, 75%, and 18% of PCa detection according to PI-RADS scores of 5, 4, and 3, respectively, including clinically insignificant PCa (24). In our data set, 91%, 77%, and 48% of all lesions with PI-RADS scores of 5 (_n_ = 77), 4 (_n_ = 66), and 3 (_n_ = 25), respectively, corresponded to csPCa foci at RP histopathologic analysis. In the PROMIS study, the group with positive results at MRI showed csPCa in 81%, 58%, and 21% of all lesions with PI-RADS scores of 5, 4, and 3, respectively. Our results confirm that a higher PI-RADS score corresponds to a higher likelihood of csPCa detection and a higher GS. The relatively higher proportion of csPCa in PI-RADS 3 lesions in the present study are comparable to two of 26 studies in a meta-analysis of PI-RADS 3 lesions; these studies were the only others in the meta-analysis to use whole-mount specimen data (25). We suggest that PI-RADS 3 classification therefore may underrepresented some GS according to the true standard (26).

In the intervention group, 151 of 207 (72.9%) men had PCa that was detected (targeted and systematic biopsy) versus 124 of 206 (60.2%) men in the control group (systematic biopsy). There was a higher probability of PCa detection in the intervention versus control group (_P_ <.001) and when adjusted for minimization variables (odds ratio, 2.16; 95% CI: 1.3, 3.4). This contrasts with results from the PRECISION study, in which image fusion-targeted biopsies outperformed systematic random biopsies (2). Men randomized to biopsies only in the PRECISION study underwent transrectal US-guided biopsy, which potentially introduced measurement bias in the cohort undergoing systematic biopsies.

In the MULTIPROS study, only men with findings at multiparametric MRI that were positive for PCa were randomized, and the control group undergoing systematic random biopsies had a confirmed prebiopsy MRI examination with positive findings, modifying the pretest probability of systematic biopsies and improving their predictive value. Although there is still debate regarding the optimal biopsy technique in men without biopsy

Table 4: Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events Reported in the Control Group and Intervention Group

Figure 4: Images from multiparametric MRI of the prostate in a 60-year-old male participant show a focal lesion (arrow) in the right peripheral zone of the prostate or the mid-gland level. The lesion had low TI2 signal on **(A)** axial and **(B)** aggifl TI2-weighted MRI scans, marked corresponding restricted diffusion on **(C)** apparent diffusion coefficient and **(D)** high-b-value diffusion-weighted MRI scans, and **(B)** early contrast enhancement on a dynamic contrast enhanced MRI scan. The lesion was a maximum of 13 mm on transverse axis with a bulge of the prostate outline but no definite extoposatate extension. This was scored as Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System 4. Fused **(F)** isovolumetric TI2 sequence with **(G)** US image. Squeeze marker A is placed at the level of proximal prostatic urethane as an anatomic landmark. Fusion core showed a Gleason score of 3+4 prostate cancer.

and with lesions suspicious for cancer at MRI (27), combined systematic and targeted biopsies for PI-RADS 4 or 5 scores are superior to targeted or systematic biopsies alone in detecting csPCA (26,28-30).

The only procedure-related serious adverse event was one participant with sepsis, which occurred in each arm of the study. Sepsis is a well-recognized complication of transrectal prostate biopsies (31). In our series, the higher number of immediate adverse events after biopsy might be related to the higher number of cores obtained at combined biopsy.

Our study had limitations. Histopathologic Gleason grading is susceptible to discrepancy between expert pathologists (32-34). A future retrospective study would verify the consistency among pathologic reports in MULTIPROS. A limitation to MULTIPROS was the lack of interobserver variability among pathologists. PI-RADS version 2.0 was used for the assessment of multiparametric MRI during our study, and this was replaced by the updated version 2.1 in 2019. For consistency, the version used for assessment of multiparametric MRI during the study (version 2.0) remained unchanged, and version 2.1 consisted of only minor alterations (35). Differences between versions 2.0 and 2.1 relate predominantly to classification of low and indeterminate lesions (PI-RADS 2 and 3) in the transition zone and assessment of intermediate lesions in the peripheral zone to reduce their number, resulting in increased diagnostic accuracy of the scoring system (36-38). Template biopsies yield higher tissue sampling density than do targeted or systematic biopsies (14), sampling areas of higher-grade PCa, overrepresenting the true disease extent and leading to downgrading at final histopathologic analysis. If a core sample is only GS 4, reporting will be 4+-4 (GS 8) (14). However, the surrounding tissue is often positive for cancer, with a GS of 3 (39). Therefore, at the periphery of high-grade disease, RP pathology shows 3+-4 (GS 7) or 4+-3 (GS 7). A single GS 8 transperineal prostate mapping biopsy core strongly biases results toward overgrading. We suggest that transcriptomic and radiomic data at the lesion level in the future might enable a better understanding of intralesional patterns of disease grade. The majority of the missed csPCA lesions were smaller than 15 mm and located in the anterior half of the gland. This observation will be useful for the reporting radiologist to include the anterior gland as a focused review area.

In conclusion, MRI performed before biopsy with categorization using Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System version 2.0 was accurate in helping detect clinically significant prostate cancer (PCa), with acceptable interobserver agreement. Combined US and MRI fusion-targeted biopsies and systematic random biopsies helped detect more clinically significant lesions than either modality alone. Further work is warranted in explaining why multiparametric MRI does not depict PCa that is subsequently detected at biopsy and radical prostatectomy.
